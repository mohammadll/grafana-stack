## ðŸ’¡ Description
The Grafana LGTM stack is a comprehensive set of open-source tools designed for monitoring, observability, and visualization. It includes several key components, each serving a specific purpose to provide a complete solution for monitoring applications and infrastructure. If you are interested in setting up a Grafana LGTM stack and working with it on a kubernetes clsuter, please follow the instructions provided in this repository.

## :wrench: What tools do we want to use in this repository
  - **Loki**: a log aggregation system designed to store and query logs from all your applications and infrastructure. https://grafana.com/oss/loki/
  - **Grafana**: allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored. https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/
  - **Tempo**: an open source, easy-to-use, and high-scale distributed tracing backend. https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/
  - **Mimir**: an open source, horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant TSDB for long-term storage for Prometheus. https://grafana.com/oss/mimir/
  - **Agent**: is a batteries-included, open source telemetry collector for collecting metrics, logs, and traces. https://grafana.com/oss/agent/

## ðŸ”Ž What do we want to do
  - **Traces with Tempo**:
     - We want to write a simple Python app, collect its spans and traces using the `OpenTelemetry Kubernetes operator`, forward these traces to `Tempo`, and finally visualize the traces using `Grafana`.
  - **Metrics with Mimir and Logs with Loki**:
     - Using the `agent operator` to collect kubelet and cAdvisor metrics exposed by the kubelet service. Each node in your cluster exposes kubelet metrics at /metrics and cAdvisor metrics at /metrics/cadvisor. Finally, remotely writing these metrics to `Mimir` and visualizing them with `Grafana`
     - Using the `agent operator` to collect logs from the cluster nodes, shipping them to a remote `Loki` endpoint and visualizing them with `Grafana`.


## :one: Scenario-1: Traces with Tempo

Create a unique Kubernetes namespace for tempo and grafana:

    kubectl create namespace tempo
    kubectl create namespace grafana

Set up a Helm repository using the following commands:

    helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
    helm repo update

Use the following command to install Tempo using the configuration options weâ€™ve specified in the `tempo-values.yml` file:

    helm -n tempo install tempo grafana/tempo-distributed -f tempo-values.yml

Use the following command to install Grafana using the configuration options weâ€™ve specified in the `grafana-values-scenario-1.yml` file:

    helm -n grafana install grafana grafana/grafana -f grafana-values-scenario-1.yml

To install the Opentelemetry Operator in an existing cluster, make sure you have cert-manager installed and run:

    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-operator.yaml

Create an OpenTelemetry `Collector` and an `Instrumentation` resource with the configuration for the SDK and instrumentation.

    kubectl apply -f colllector.yml
    kubectl apply -f instrument.yml

Go to `trace-python-app` directory and build the docker image using this command: `docker build -t myapp .` and then:

    kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
    kubectl apply -f service.yml

Use `port-forward` to connect to `my-app`, like this: `kubectl port-forward POD_NAME 8080` and then Go to your browser and type:

    http://localhost:8080/rolldice

Refresh the page multiple times. if you want to see the traces, use `port-forward` to connect to `grafana` and Go to `Explore`. You'll see the traces of my-app
